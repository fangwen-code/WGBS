Bismark report for: /hwfssz5/ST_BIOINTEL/P18Z10200N0374/wenfang/Pipeline/DNAm/workflow/testResult/Trim_galore/pearTest/pearTest_val_1.fq.gz and /hwfssz5/ST_BIOINTEL/P18Z10200N0374/wenfang/Pipeline/DNAm/workflow/testResult/Trim_galore/pearTest/pearTest_val_2.fq.gz (version: v0.24.2)
Bismark was run with Bowtie 2 against the bisulfite genome of /hwfssz5/ST_BIOINTEL/P18Z10200N0374/wenfang/Software/Bismark-master/test_files/ with the specified options: -q -N 1 -L 32 --score-min L,0,-0.2 --ignore-quals --no-mixed --no-discordant --dovetail --maxins 500
Option '--non_directional' specified: alignments to all strands were being performed (OT, OB, CTOT, CTOB)

Final Alignment report
======================
Sequence pairs analysed in total:	5000
Number of paired-end alignments with a unique best hit:	4619
Mapping efficiency:	92.4% 
Sequence pairs with no alignments under any condition:	0
Sequence pairs did not map uniquely:	381
Sequence pairs which were discarded because genomic sequence could not be extracted:	0

Number of sequence pairs with unique best (first) alignment came from the bowtie output:
CT/GA/CT:	2323	((converted) top strand)
GA/CT/CT:	0	(complementary to (converted) top strand)
GA/CT/GA:	0	(complementary to (converted) bottom strand)
CT/GA/GA:	2296	((converted) bottom strand)
